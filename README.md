# luaShootingGallary
A repository where I can practice making a shooting gallery game with lua

### Additional Game Feature Ideas
- Add some kind of system where it displays 1, 2 or 3 points depending on how well you shoot the target.
- Display a 'high score' where it shows the highest score so far.
- Display a message that says "high score!" when you get the high score.
